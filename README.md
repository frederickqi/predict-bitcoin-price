# predict-bitcoin-price


Project Introduction:
As Twitter starts to hook up attention of the general public after being acquired and reconstructed by Elon Musk recently, many people from various fields proactively initiate discussions regarding the future of the digital social platform and which kind of roles that Twitter should play in our modern society. On the other hand, the blockchain-based technologies embraced by Bitcoin represents a new emerging trend for the future, decentralized, peer-to-peer, looser control and virtualization. However, due to lack of concrete applications in the real world, we have witnessed recurrent price discrepancies in cryptocurrency markets across countries in the past decades (Chen Qin Jiang, 2022). The attribute of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin has been widely acknowledged and taken by hedging investment organizations as an efficient tool to neutralize their investment risks incurred from other related fields. Bitcoin has been always considered as an investment asset which is extremely hard to predict because one of the major problems with many price predictions about bitcoin is that they lack sufficient analytical support to back up their claims (Reiff, 2021). The most conventional and prevalent way to predict the price fluctuations of it nowadays is to comprehensively dig into the base factors of bitcoin, including fiat currencies, political factors, economics factors, etc. However, we are eager to take an initiative to focus on the attitudes of celebrities towards bitcoins instead to analyze how their sentimental comments would potentially impact on the price change of bitcoins. In order to precisely tackle our hypothesis set up in the first place, we were moving forward with various quantitative methods and tools, such as Cross-correlation for Time-Series Analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentiment Analysis, etc. In the end, in order to further convert our hypothesis into a concrete application for predicting the price fluctuations as a technical tool, we were luckily exposed to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms to implement the model and train the data for further prediction purposes.
